# Diploma project (analytics system for oil and gas wells)
In this repository you can find my diploma project. In this project, I created **analytics system** for oil and gas wells. It includes building *different types of charts (bar, pie chart)*, showing information about wells in *table* format, *displaying wells on the map*. Also, it includes interface for standard CRUD operations to manage wells and other objects from oil and gas extraction domain.


## Tech stack
**Backend** - Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker


**Frontend** - Django templates

## What was implemented
 - comprehensive set of Django models, which depicts oil and gas extraction domain
 - script for pre-populating database with test values
 - standard CRUD operations
 - logic for building charts
 - Dockerfile to start the whole system in Docker container

## Results
Here you can find some screenshots of the resulting system
